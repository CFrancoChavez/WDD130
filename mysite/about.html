                    I love technology and building functional things, putting them into operation and having everything fit and produce the
                    expected results is exciting! The first language I learned was JavaScript through a Google App, I decided and I started
                    studying Python as part of the first certificate in Computer & Web Programming awarded by Brigham Young University Idaho
                    and from then on I haven't stopped progress in my training by acquiring more valuable skills. I have created a form for
                    you to leave your email and share your opinion about the site as well as the opinions you want to share.
